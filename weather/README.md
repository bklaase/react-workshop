# React openweather api exercise
This is a very rudimentary react app, bootstrapped with the "create-react-app" cli tool.

## TODO
- [x] Retrieve weather for a location based on usercontrol
- [x] Display weather summary in separte component
- [ ] Make use of react router, to allow "deep linking" to locations
- [ ] Demonstrate use of (find excuse for) React Context API within this app
